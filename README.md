## Bubble Struggle

This is a simple game app. The aim of the game is to touch the screen to avoid the rain drops and survive for as long as possible. This was my first attempt at making a game and it wasnâ€™t initially made to be published. The game mechanics are very simple but a lot of additional features such as menu buttons that move, realistic multilayered moving background and slight movements of the player bubble add to the complexity. The art was all created by me.

The game is written in Java and uses the libgdx framework and also the Universal Tween Engine API. Libgdx is cross-platform and so the game can be run on windows, iOS or even on a website.
